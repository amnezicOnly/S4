There are some modifications I've made :
	- I added a color attribute in the Players class in order to ease the drawing of the board for each lap
	- I added a couldEat method in Players class in order to know easier if the currentPlayer could eat a specific cell
	- I removed the String[] lifeForms of the class Players because I never used it
	- in hasEnoughNeigbor in each Players class, I added some variables to conform with the rules that let a player eat a cell, because in the last milestone, we didn't make a true difference between cells a player could eat and free cells
	- in hasEnoughNeigbor in each Players class, I divided each case of cell to ease the count of each type of cell
	- I changed the return type of hasEnoughNeigbor from Cell[] to List<Cell> because it's way more convenient than an array
	- in newLap() method in World class, I changed a if block because I made a special case for Herbivors to check if they have at least 1 turn left but because new classes need to check this condition too, I just check the condition, for all classes

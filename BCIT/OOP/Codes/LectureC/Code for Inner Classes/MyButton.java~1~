    MyListener is another inner class, however this one has a name.
    Inner classes defined this way allow multiple objects of this type
    to be created. It's sometimes clearer too.

    Inner classes have full access to the outer classes members (including
    private). Think of them as just another (special) member.
    Usually used for Listener type class definitions

    This class deals with action events (button pressed usually)
    When an action event occurs, the outer classes content pane's background
    colour is toggled between orange and blue

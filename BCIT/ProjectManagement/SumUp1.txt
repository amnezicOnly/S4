Hello everyone !
Tonight I'm going to show you what my team (Amber, Erica, Esteban and I) had done since the previous class.
To begin, we did the background of the Softec College : a British Columbian college in Vancouver who serve 8.500 students each year. It's a huge university which has a lot of facilities that could be booked by externals. Therefore, The Facilities Booking system project is to improve the convenience and efficiency of facility reservations by reducing the workload of the facilities coordinator and enhancing primary users to maintain control over the booking of special facilities.
Firstly, we have discussed about who are the stakeholders, which one are internal and which one are external. It was difficult sometimes to understand why some people are internal and others aren't. So, we have decided that internal stakeholders were mostly Softec College staff such as the chancellor as investor and the dean as sponsor but also the IT team with and the facility manager. External stakeholders are all the people who indirectly help to the making of the product, the software vendor, and the end users, like students and third party event organizers.
